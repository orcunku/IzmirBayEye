IZMIRBAYEYE AI: TECHNICAL EXPLANATION & LOGIC
============================================================

1. SCIENTIFIC PARAMETERS USED:
------------------------------
- Dissolved Oxygen (DO): Measures hypoxia. Below 3.5mg/L, 
  odor-producing anaerobic bacteria become active.
- ORP (Redox Potential): Negative values indicate a state 
  of organic decomposition (rotting) in the bay.
- Ammonia (NH3): High levels indicate nitrogen-rich waste 
  (sewage/runoff) that fuels algae and odor.
- Chlorophyll & Turbidity: Measure biological load and 
  water clarity (Eutrophication markers).

2. ALGORITHM LOGIC (src/engine.py):
-----------------------------------
The system uses a "Penalty-Based Weighting" system:
- 50% Weight (Chemical): Focuses on Oxygen and ORP. These 
  are the direct triggers for H2S gas.
- 30% Weight (Biological): Focuses on algae density.
- 20% Weight (Physical): Focuses on wind and temperature. 
  Heat speeds up the smell, low wind traps it.

3. DATA PERSISTENCE:
--------------------
Every time the /monitor endpoint is called, the system 
appends the results to 'history.json'. This allows for 
future trend analysis and machine learning training.

4. USER INTERFACE:
------------------
The 'mobile_app' folder contains a Flutter UI that 
visualizes these complex biochemical readings into a 
simple "Risk Percentage" for the average citizen.
